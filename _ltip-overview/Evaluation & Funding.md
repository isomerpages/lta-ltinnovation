The submissions / proposals will be evaluated based on the following few broad criterias.
| Criteria | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| Objective     | The solution should be aligned with clear objectives (such as against the key goals of LTMP 2040 or problem statements) and demonstrates steps in achieving them.     |
| Innovativeness     | The solution should be innovative and not already available or commercialised in the market. The solution should not be already funded by other initiative by LTA or another agency.     |
| Scalability & Implementation     | The implementation plan should be stated in the submission, including the expected timeline, manpower and resources required, intermediate deliverables and eventual outcomes. The solution should have the potential to scale, and hence not be overly convoluted in its implementation with realistic deliverables and outcomes.     |
| Outcomes     | The solution should be outcome-based, with the targeted outcomes or results clearly stated in the proposal.     |

Shortlisted solutions may be funded up to 70% (?) depending on the level of innovativeness, scalability, technology readiness and duration. Funding requirements and details will be determined by the eventual funding party or source once the solution proposal has been finalised.
